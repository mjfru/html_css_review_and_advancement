-- Text Transform --
The - text-transform - property changes the capitalization (uppercase, lowercase, capitalize) of text.
This is merely stylistic, it does not alter the actual HTML.

p {
    text-transform: uppercase; (capitalizes everything in p tags.)
}


-- Text Decoration --
Sets the appearance of decorative lines on text.
Can create multitudes of underlines (dotted, solid, wavy, dashed, double, etc).
This can be seen in the default styling for <a> tags!

This is known as a shorthand property; four properties are baked into one.

So this:
h2 {
    text-decoration-line: line-through;
    text-decoration-color: navy;
    text-decoration-style: wavy;
}

Can become this:
h2 {
    text-decoration: navy line-through wavy;
}

Also, you can remove default underlines by setting the following:

a {
    text-decoration: none;
}

A newer property is text-decoration-thickness, which can also be inserted into the shorthand property as well.


-- The ID Selector --
Including id="name" in the opening tag can hone in on a single element we want to style or select.

In CSS, the # selects an id, followed by the name of the id.
However, you are only supposed to have one of each unique per page!
The whole concept is that an ID occurs only one time.

#name {
    font-weight: bold;
}


-- The Class Selector --
Classes are typically used when we have multiple elements we want to style, there are no limitations unlike with IDs.

In CSS, the . selects the class, followed by its name.

.highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
    text-decoration: underline;
}


-- Styling Lists --
The property list-style-type is responsible for controlling the markers next to line items in unordered lists.
(It's even more customizable with the @counter-style rule, more on that later.)
These include: disk (default), circle, square, decimal, none, etc.
* Nav bars typically use lists that do without any kind of styling.

#my_ul_list {
    list-style-type: circle;
}

You can also put a character of your choosing by typing: list-style-type: "*"; (* for example)
We can also control the position of the marker; inside or outside (default being outside). 
Finally, list-style-image lets us provide a URL to set it as the marker image.


-- Styling Links --
Users have come to expect some level of interactivity when it comes to links.
An underline beneath the link, your cursor changing shapes, a pop-out box previewing what the link goes to.
Perhaps you visited the page and go back to the original one; typically, the visited link changes colors to indicate that it was used.

This is where we use a pseudo-class.

a:hover {   (This is used heavily!)
    text-decoration: underline;
    color: orangered;
}

a:visited {
    color: violet;
}


-- Cursor --
Your cursor can be customized too!
You can change it for its default behavior, when you're hovering a clickable element, or want some special feature. (Pointer is the default.)

a {
    cursor: crosshair;
}


-- Font --
Yes, this is its own property and it's a shorthand one!
This sets all the different properties of an element's font at once (family, size, stretch, style, variant, weight, height).
Values that are absolutely required are the font-size and font-family.

h1 {
    font: 400 50px serif;
}
(weight, size, family)
