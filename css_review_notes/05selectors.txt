-- Selectors --

-- The Universal Selector --
The universal selector (*) selects everything in the document.
This is mostly used when we want to reset styles. It's very rare that we'd want to have something applied to -everything- on the page.

* {
    margin: 0;                  Resets the default margins
    border: 2px solid blue      Everything on the page, every element will have a border.
}

-- Review of Other Selectors (So Far!) --

p {
    color: red;                 Makes all p elements red.
}

.nav {
    text-decoration: none;      Makes all elements with the class 'nav' appear w/o decoration
}

#feature {
    background-color: gold;     Makes the single id of feature have a gold background.
}


-- The Attribute Selector --
The attribute selector can choose elements based on the presence or value or certain attributes.
For example, you can select what -kind- of input you want to target with the attribute selector.
The syntax looks like this: the element we want to select, [type="____"] (the value we're trying to match, i.e. email or password).

input[type="number"] {
    background-color: green;
}

There is some fancier syntax for being even more specific, however.

a[href*="wiki"] {
    color: blue;                Links with "wiki" anywhere in the URL will be blue.
}

a[href^="#'] {
    color: gold;                Links with a URL that starts with '#' will be gold.
                                (Reminder: Links to another part of the document)
}

a[href$=".org"] {
    color: green;               Links with a URL that ends with ".org". will be green.
}


-- Grouping Selectors Together --
A simple comma can select two elements together.
This is really common practice to keep consistency with styling your webpage.

h1, h2 {
    text-decoration: underline;
}

This can be applied to anything, ids, classes, etc. and they do not have to be the same type of selectors either.


-- Descendant Combinator --
The " " (space) combinator selects elements that are descendants of the first element!

div h2 {
    color: red;                 This selects only h2 tags that are children (inside) of a div!
}

#special span {
    background-color: green;    Selects only spans inside of the 'special' id tag.
}

You can have multiple layers too... #special li span {...} for example.

There's a second combinator as well, the Child Combinator (direct descendant):

ul > li {
    ** !style! **
}

The > combinator selects elements that are ONLY DIRECT children of the first element.


-- Compound Selector --
We can combine class, id, and element selectors (without spaces - important!).
The example below selects divs with the class "special"

div.special {
    ** !style! **               Most commonly paired with classes, like this
}

h2#intro {
    color: violet;
}

** Important to note that elements can have more than one class!
