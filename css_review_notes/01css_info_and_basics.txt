-- Ways to Style with CSS --
There are 3 different ways we can write styles in CSS:
    1. Inline
    2. Internal
    3. External


-- Inline Styling --
So naturally, let's start with the worst way first, inline styling!
With inline styling, we directly embed our styling information into the HTML tag.

<p style="color:blue;">Lorem ipsum</p>
This is cumbersome because we have to go through each element and type out the styling and there is no styling being shared between pages.


-- Internal Styling --
Internal here means that we embed the CSS directly into our HTML document, but not inline with the individual elements.
Here, our traditional style page is written in the <head></head> of the HTML page, where the rest of our meta data goes.

<html>
    <head>
        <style>
            p {
                color: green;
                font-size: 24px;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
</html>

This CSS will tell the <p> elements to be green and have a font-size of 24px.
No matter how many <p> tags we have, they will all follow this rule unless we specify otherwise.
The downfall of this is that if we have multiple pages, we have to go back and change each HTML page manually.
Additionally, it might add tons of properties, making your HTML page clunky and hard to change and manage.


-- External Styles --
External here means we write our CSS in another file...a CSS file and is by far the most common and practical!
In the <head> of the HTML page, we put a <link rel="stylesheet" href="app.css" />
Of course, the href may be different depending on your own naming conventions.
* Note: the <link/> is self-closing.


-- The Anatomy of CSS --
We select some element or elements and then inside of the curly braces, we specify what we want to modify.

(element) div {
    (property_name: value;)
    width: 50px;
}


-- The Element Selector --
Selects all elements of the same type.
p {
    color: red;
}

Selects all the <p> tags in your HTML page.


-- Comments in CSS --
To turn code on/off in CSS, we can use /* and stop it with */

/* body {
    background-color: red;
}
*/
The above code will be greyed-out and not working!
* Ctrl + / is a shortcut for comments in VSCode.
