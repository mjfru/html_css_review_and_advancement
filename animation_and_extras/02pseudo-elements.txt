-- ::before & ::after Pseudo-Elements --
We can use the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements to insert content onto a page via CSS without needing it to be in the HTML!

We've seen things like: p::first_line, h1::first_letter, p::selection before.

More commonly, however, are the slightly strange ::before and ::after
With these, we insert a child of an element without having to edit our HTML at all.

CSS:                        HTML:
div::before {               <div>
    content: "hello";           hello
}                           <! -- rest of div content -->
                                goodbye
div::after {                </div>
    content: "goodbye";
}

While this example seems fairly useless, there are quite a few great use-cases for this.
Note: This should NEVER be used to any content we consider to be absolutely essential.
This is only really used for decorative purposes.
An example like this might be to include really decorative quotation marks around, well, a quote.


-- Gradient Borders with Pseudo-Elements --
The examples of gradient borders, both with and without, are an example of when to use a pseudo-element.
In the first example, (index.html), the <div> that provides the gradient border does absolutely nothing but provide style; cluttering our HTML page and making it clunky for screen readers and skimmers.
