-- The calc() Function --
The calc() function lets us do some quick math within our CSS.

This can be useful in many different cases, but it's most commonly used when you need to create a value that is a mix of units, like percentages and pixels.

button {
    padding: calc(43px - 21px);     <-- impractical, but will equate to 22px. Do not do this.
}

Let's say we have 2 cards next to each other.
    - The left card is 40% wide with a 16px margin on the right.
    - The right card is 60% but we want it to maintain the gap between the two in the middle from the 16px margin.

We can use calc() to account for that 16px margin and subtract it from the 60% width!

.card1 {
    width: 40%;
    float: left;
    margin-right: 16px;
}

.card2 {
    width: calc(60% - 16px);
    float: right;
}


-- The Rules of Calc() --
    - You can use four operators: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    - White space is needed around the addition and subtraction operators.
    - Dividing by 0 will cause errors.
    - You can next calc() functions
    - You can use CSS variables within calc() functions
