-- Common HTML Elements --

-- Unordered Lists --
Unordered lists are created using the <ul> </ul> tags and populating them with line items - <li> </li> tags within.
Unordered lists create a bulleted list of items.

Example:
<ul>
    <li>Flour</li>
    <li>Baking Soda</li>
    <li>Brown Sugar</li>
</ul>

-- Ordered Lists --
These act nearly the same as unordered lists but have numerical values instead of bullets.
The rules are the same except we now use <ol> </ol> and populate them with <li> </li>.

Example:
<ol>
    <li>Preheat Oven</li>
    <li>Grease Pan</li>
    <li>Bake for 30 minutes</li>
</ol>

You should never have an <li> tag by itself, they belong in a list!

You can also nest lists within other lists.
For example:
<h2>Recipe Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Breast</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>Tomatoes
            <ul>
                <li>Canned Tomatoes</li>
                <li>Fresh Tomatoes</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>


-- The Em, Strong, B, and I Elements - Text-based Elements --

-- Emphasis --
<p>"Just <em>do</em> it already!"</p>
The <em> elements surrounds text that should have a stressed emphasis relative to the text around it.
Most browsers will render it in italics but CSS can change this if you wish.

-- Italics / Idiomatic Text Element --
Use the <i> element for text that is set off from the normal text for some reason (foreign words, technical terms, etc.).
Use it for text that is traditionally italicized, only when there is not a more suitable element!
Recently, there has been a CSS movement to avoid using stylized elements that can be done in CSS.

-- Strong --
Use the strong <strong> element for text that has special significance.
Browsers will display this as bold, but again, you can change this in CSS.
<p>Whatever you do, <strong>do not let the cats out!</strong></p>

-- Bold - Bring More Attention to --
Use the <b> element to bring attention to text.
Use it for text that is traditionally bolded, only when there is not a more suitable element.
<p>This is an <b>HTML</b> course.</p>


-- Nesting Elements --
HTML is really all about nesting elements together.
For example, everything is in our initial <html> tag, then our body contains all our content, such as header tags, p tags, and so on.
Within a tag may be another tag, such as a <p> tag using a <em> tag within it.


-- Superscript <sup> & Subscript --
Superscript <sup> </sup> is used to designate text with a raised baseline with smaller text, such as a common date-naming convention <h1>4<sup>th</sup> of July</h1> or exponents for example.

Subscript <sub> </sub> is used to designate text with a lowered baseline with smaller text, such as chemical formulas...<h1>H<sub>2</sub>0</h1>.


-- Inline vs. Block Elements --
Certain elements take up an entire block, they go ALL the way across their container.
Inline elements only take up what is required for itself. <p> tags are a great example of this.
Inline elements will not push each other onto new lines but block elements will.


-- Creating Links, the <a> Tag --
Links require two pieces of information to be inserted into our HTML page:
    1. Link text - What does the link actually say?
    2. Destination - The url address to the other webpage.

Use the anchor <a> element to create hyperlinks to other webpages and documents.
<a href="https://github.com">My Github</a>
The 'href' here is an attribute, a property of an element, that go inside the -opening- tag and should be the url address to the desired site.


-- Other Types of Links --

-- Relative Links --
These are links that go to other local pages that you've created, say, to go from the 'home' page to the 'about' page.
That syntax would look like this:
<a href="contact.html"> About </a>

-- Links to Elements --
We can create links to elements on the same page if the element has an id (another type of attribute) assigned to it.

<a href="#section_below> Jump to the next section </a>
<h2 id="section_below"> This is the next section! </h2>


-- Images --
We can create image elements using the <img> tag...and no, it does not have a closing tag!
<img src="dog.png" alt="my dog">
The 'src', source, attribute specifies the location of the image to be displayed.
These images can be local or on the internet. (Colt showed Unsplash as a good source for images.)
The 'alt' attribute stands for alternate text and is used for screen readers or if there is an issue with our image loading.
