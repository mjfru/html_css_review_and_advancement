The point of HTML is to take regular text and...mark it up!
We can do this by italicizing text, creating headings, making links take us to other pages, etc.
HTML was even created to allow research papers to be more easily shared.
Imagine someone proofreading your paper and them saying "Make this a heading! This should be a button. This needs an input."


-- HTML Elements --
HTML consists of LOTS of elements that we can pick from to achieve different outcomes.
There are over 100+ elements: headers, links, divs, paragraphs, spans, etc.


-- <p> - Paragraph --
A very common one is the <p></p> tag, the paragraph.
Tags like these are important because our text editor ignores whitespace.


-- HTML Document Structure --
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <!-- Meta Data Goes Here -->
    <title>My Page</title>
<body>
    <!-- Content Goes Here -->
    <h1></h1>
    <p></p>
</body>
</head>
</html>

A shortcut to make all of this is simply typing '!' and tab when creating a new HTML document in VSCode.


-- Comments in HTML --
Browsers will ignore any code wrapped in comment tags.
Use comments to write notes in your code or temporarily disable elements.
They open with '<!--' and close with '-->'. 
Your note or code you want to disable goes between these.

In VSCode, if you select your code and press CTRL + '/', it acts as a shortcut.
You can also do this by selecting 'Ctrl' + 'p' to open the command palette and search for comment toggles (or find the shortcut for comments).


-- Creating Headings --
Headings add structure to our document and six different headings and section headings are available for us to use.
<h1> - <h6> (all with closing tags, of course), h1 having the largest default font-size with h6 having the smallest.

Do NOT choose heading tags based on what font size you want. This can always be changed with CSS.
<h1></h1> is reserved for only the main topic of your page. Best practice is to only have one per page.
You should NOT use <h6>, <h5>, etc. tags if you do not have all of the levels above it filled.
You shouldn't go from a <h3>, not have an <h4>, and then use an <h5>, for example.
