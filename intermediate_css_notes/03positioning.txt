-- Positioning --
Refers to a property called position that goes alongside other properties: top, right, bottom, left, and z-index.
This specifies where an element will be placed on a document.
This is useful for stacking elements and fine-tuning positions of divs, containers, etc.


-- Static --
This is the default value for position and it allows elements to fit in the normal flow of the document.
Positioning attributes such as top, right, bottom, left, and z-index have no effect on statically positioned elements.

p {
    border: 1px solid black;
    background-color: cyan;
    margin: 30px;
    font-size: 2rem;
    position: static;   <-- this will have no effect on the appearance, as it's the default value anyway
}


-- Relative --
Element fits in the normal flow of the document but...
Top, right, bottom, left, and z-index can be used to 'scoot' the element from its default spot.
Even if the element is offset, its original space in the document is maintained.
This 'unlocks' it to be moved around.

.relative-example {
    position: relative;     <-- does nothing just by itself
    top: 20px;              <-- offsets the top by 20 pixels (can also be negative)
    left: 40px;             <-- moves it down to the right (offset the left from where it would normally be)
    background-color: gold;
}


-- Z-Index --
This determines the order in which orders stack on top of each other.
A z-index of 3 will always be on top of a z-index of 2 / 1 / 0, for example.

Z-index applies ONLY to positioned elements...not static!
A z-index takes a numerical value.


-- Absolute Positioning --
Absolutely positioned elements are removed from the normal document flow and is now relative to the nearest parent element with an explicit position property.
If no parent has a position property other than default (static), it's relative to the root container.
No space will be left where it used to be!
As before, top, right, bottom, left, and z-index can be used to scoot the element around.

<h1>Positioning</h1>
<div class=box"></div>
<div class=box special"></div>
<div class=box"></div>

.box {
    background-color: green;
    display: inline-block;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
}

.special {
    background-color: orange;
    position: absolute;     <-- this causes the third box to apprarently "disappear"
    top: 0;                 <-- these illustrate the idea behind absolute. The 'special' box will move around, stacking on other elements, and the space it existed in will be ignored -- the third box moves into its old spot.
    left: 0;
}

<h1>Positioning</h1>
<div class="box">
    <span>Hi!</span>
</div>

.box {
    background-color: blue;
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
    display: inline-block;
    position: relative;
}

.box span {
    color: white;
    background-color: orangered;
    position: absolute;     <-- child of an element already positioned 
    right: 0;               <-- will move totally to the right of its parent (if parent is not positioned, would move to the right corner of the web page.)
